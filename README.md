Freebook is an online application where you can search, save and read free books.
If you've ever been curious about what freely accessible books are out there, Freebook is a great application to browse and maybe find your book (or similar books on that theme!).
For example, did you know that in the US you can read freely available parodies of Harry Potter? And you can do that on Freebook!

Here's a walkthrough;
On creating an account, and with thanks to Google Books, you has access to a powerful search engine that delivers results including the Title, Author(s), Published Date and a brief description of the book if available:
all of which are free to use and read.
The initial search can be reached from the navigation bar, you will arrive on the homepage which will have an empty shelf on it, and a notification that you're not reading anything yet.
You're advised to search for a book.

Once you've entered a query in the search bar, you are taken to a results page with a small form at the top.
You can then refine your search by either Title, Authors or Publisher. You are given an input field to add the additional information, otherwise the search is performed on your original search query.
Each result appears as a thumbnail image with the information on it's right, the image itself is a link.
Once clicked, you are taken to your 'Reading' page and the book is displayed in the embedded viewer and has arrived at the default page in the book.

On the left is a vertical list of all the books you are currently reading (there shouldn't be any there yet but the one you've just selected), each book is another image with a link to start reading now, similar to the search result thumbnails.
Once clicked, the page and viewer will reload with this book, but don't worry, the page number you were on will have been stored (if the book has page numbers) so you wont lose your place!

Back to the search results;
As well as having a linked thumbnail to start reading a book, each result has two optional buttons to either add a book to your bookcase for later, or to tell Freebook that you've already read a book.
Both collections will appear in the bookcase on your homepage, and in a page accessed through the navigation bar under the dropdown menu 'My Account', you'll find both collections ('Finished' and 'Bookcase') in here for you to amend.
In both the homapage and 'My Bookcase', each book triggers a modal of information about the book and where you can tell Freebook you've now finished this book (if it was in your Bookcase and not your finished list).

One final page accessed from the nav bar is 'settings' which is under 'My Account'.
Here, you can change your password or delete your account and any data held about you.

And finally, Log out.

Freebook was written using Python, Flask and JQuery and with a lot of thanks to Google Books and its extensive documentation.
